How to describe the connections between locations:
1. [Graph Theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graph_theory)
2. [Connectivity Matrix](https://transportgeography.org/?page_id=6969)

This game seems to require a *directed graph* as the connections between locations are not always equal.
ex) Venus Orbit to Venus- Difficulty 0, Venus to Venus Orbit- Difficulty 6
